# LyonPotpourri

LyonPotpourri is a collection of externals developed for the creation and performance of computer music. The externals were originally developed for Max/MSP, and then extended into hybrid code that could compile for both Max/MSP and Pd. As of version 3.0, LyonPotpourri has diverged into separate Pd and Max/MSP versions. The Pd version is available [here](https://github.com/ericlyon/pd-lyonpotpourri).
